        <h2>How to get to Alexandroupoli from Istanbul?</h2>
        <p>You will need to cross the Turkish-Greek border. The most common route is to take the E90 highway (also
          known as the D100 in Turkey) and drive westward towards Edirne, which is approximately a three-hour drive from
          Istanbul. Once you reach Edirne, you will need to cross the border into Greece and continue driving westward
          on the E90 highway towards Alexandroupoli, which is approximately a two-hour drive from the border. It is
          recommended that you check the current border crossing regulations and travel requirements before embarking on
          your journey.</p>

      <h2>Things to do in Alexandroupoli</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Alexandroupoli is a beautiful coastal city in northeastern Greece, offering a wide variety of activities and
          attractions to enjoy during the summer months. Some of the top things to do include exploring the city's rich
          history and culture, enjoying the beach, and experiencing the local cuisine.
          For history and culture buffs, a visit to the Alexandroupoli Lighthouse is a must. Built in 1880, the
          lighthouse offers stunning panoramic views of the city and the Aegean Sea. Another must-see attraction is the
          Ethnological Museum of Thrace, which showcases the region's history and culture through exhibits of
          traditional clothing, crafts, and more.
          The city is also home to several beautiful beaches, such as Delfini Beach and Agia Paraskevi Beach, where
          visitors can relax and enjoy the sun, sand, and sea. Additionally, the city's bustling port area is a great
          place to take a stroll, enjoy a coffee, and people-watch.
          Finally, no trip to Alexandroupoli is complete without trying some of the local cuisine. The city is known for
          its fresh seafood, traditional Greek dishes, and delicious desserts. Visitors can try local favorites like
          grilled octopus, moussaka, and loukoumades, a type of fried doughnut covered in honey and cinnamon.
          With its rich history, beautiful beaches, and delicious cuisine, Alexandroupoli is a great destination for a
          summer getaway.
